# l4d2-plugins
some of the plugins written for [these servers](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/l4d2hardx)

the names are prefixed with numbers, meant to categorize them when buried within a server's plugins directory.
The categories are as followed:
* 0_ requirement for other plugins, serving no function on its own
* 1_ general category for plugins with any type of gameplay function
* 2_ plugins whose only function is to relay info
* 3_ admin functions, usually ones that do nothing but add commands only accessible to admins
* 4_ plugins that fix a bug, without any major gameplay impact. If a bug fix ends up impacting gameplay balance in a huge way, then that plugin should be prefixed as 1_ instead

the plugins shared here are the ones i'm comfortable with sharing. Please don't request my other ones. They're not here by choice, but may be added in the future.

/left4dead2/addons/sourcemod/ <- this is where you install these in case you're unfamiliar with installing sm plugins
