**WORK IN PROGRESS**; more will be added~

plugins that complement eachother quite well, together achieving better SI audio feedback

* [unsilent_jockey](https://github.com/SirPlease/L4D2-Competitive-Rework/blob/master/addons/sourcemod/scripting/l4d2_unsilent_jockey.sp) had a tiny update to fix a tiny bug. All credits go to original
* proximity_jockey_volume *can* be expanded to cover all SI, but every one except the jockey has very clear cues for each attack/ability. Jockeys make no sound when they use their ability, so they're the only one i felt would benefit from this. Default convar values can probably be fine tuned, but it's better than vanilla! (especially combined with unsilent_jockey. No more silent jockey excuses!!)
