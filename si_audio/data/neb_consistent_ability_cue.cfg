// the sound files don't exist by default in dedicated server installations.
// You could add all the sounds and use a function to determine length by examining the file,
// but I'd rather keep the mod's files contained to the sourcemod directory.
// 
// You shouldn't need to edit any of these. These are the vanilla duration lengths of each sound
// file the plugin is expected to deal with. This file is loaded by the plugin and then referenced
// each time it needs to determine how long to set a timer that represents the duration these
// sounds shouldn't be interrupted by non-priority sounds.
//
// oh and every / is replaced with a : because otherwise the keys can't be found
