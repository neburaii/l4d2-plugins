"neb_skip_intro"
{
	// For any map not specified here, it will behave according to the following:
	// - skip can only happen if it's the first map of a campaign
	// - once it first begins processing a skip, it will start a 60 second timer. Any cutscenes/intros that happen after the 60 second timer finishes will not be skipped
	//
	// In this file, you can force desired behaviour per map.
	// You can set 2 different keyvalues:
	// - "skip"
	//		1 to force skip functionality for this map, 0 to force it off
	// - "timer"
	//		if skip is enabled, for how long after the first processed skip will skips still be possible? (set to 0 to disable timer, making any cutscene within this map skip no matter what)
	//
	//
	// Example entry:
	//
	// "c2m5_concert"
	// {
	//		"skip" 1
	//		"timer" 0.0
	// }
	//
	// In the above example, skip is forced to be on for the full duration of the map (you probably don't want this on this specific map. Blocking rescue cutscenes will cause odd behaviour, but this is just for the sake of giving an example)
	// You can also restore an intro for a specific map like this:
	//
	// "c2m1_highway"
	// {
	//		"skip" 0
	// }
	//
	// each keyvalue is optional, so if you only want to modify one like in the above example, then there's no need to specifiy the other one
